# Shadowdara's changes

Hello Dear Godot User and Creator

I had seen your `car-demo` template and really liked it!

I made some changes to it and updated it for Godot 4.4, make you are liking the changes too.

## The Changes

- updated project from 4.3 to 4.4
- added WASD keys for driving
- you can now drive with WASD and arrow keys
- removed icon.svg (the godot icon isnt required)
- changed the calculation for m/s to km/h from 3.8 to 3.6
- added a Gearshift function
  - gear 1 is * 0.3
  - gear 2 is * 0.7
  - gear 3 is the normal value (1)
  - gear 4 is * 1.3
  - gear 5 is * 1.8
- i didnt changed the engine boost when the car is below the speed 30.

## Info

Credits are not required!
- but would be cool (just my name `Shadowdara`, not more)

Yours faithfully

Shadowdara
